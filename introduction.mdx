Flutter lets you build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. You get a rich set of customizable widgets, fast development cycles with hot reload, and high performance thanks to its compiled Dart code. Whether you target iOS, Android, web browsers, or desktop platforms, Flutter handles the heavy lifting so you focus on creating beautiful, responsive user experiences.

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your First App" icon="plus">
    Generate a new project.

    ```bash
    flutter create my_app
    cd my_app
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the App" icon="play">
    Launch on your device or simulator.

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

    Expect a counter app demo. Modify `lib/main.dart` and hot reload with `r` in the terminal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

```dart
// Example from lib/main.dart - Your first Flutter app
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}
```
